# mentorship-karona
Simple, students in colleges need to connect to industry experts. During corona everyone is lockdown. Use this time to conduct virtual mentorship sessions. 

## rules
1. Only free sessions. 
2. At least 5-10 students should be in one session. Don't request for 1:1 mentorship on this forum as we'll not be able to scale that way.
3. Students have to produce (at least) one output from the session: 
	* Try to record the session, edit it with highlights and put it on Youtube. 
	* Or, write a blog with everything discussed.
	* Put up a LinkedIn post with all that you learnt from the session.
	* Anything is fine. As long as you do share what you learnt in public forum.

## how to

If you need a session with mentors raise an issue.
